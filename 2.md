**####What do the HTTP Status Codes represent?####**

*HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. There are five classes of HTTP responses:*

# Informational responses (100–199)
# Successful responses (200–299)
# Redirection messages (300–399)
# Client error responses (400–499)
# Server error responses (500–599)


**####What are the Primary HTTP Verbs and what do they mean?####**

*HTTP request methods. They are used to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource (specified by the URL) on the server. Since they indicate action they are sometimes called HTTP Verbs. The primary or most-commonly-used HTTP verbs (or methods) are POST, GET, PUT, DELETE. These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations, respectively.*

* # GET - The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource (URL). Requests using GET should only retrieve data.
* # POST - The POST method is used to create a resource on the server.
* # PUT	- The PUT method replaces a resource with the request payload(data in the body).
* # DELETE - The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.
