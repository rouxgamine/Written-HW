### _1. What is Node.js?_

**Node.js** is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime **environment** that runs on a JavaScript Engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. 


### _2. Is Node.js a programming language?_

**Node.js** is not a programming language. It's a runtime environment that's used to run JavaScript outside the browser.


### _3. Is Express a programming language?_

**Express** is a back end web application framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js. 
It is designed for building web applications and APIs.
**Express** JS is a web application framework for **Node.js**. 


### _4. What is the primary reason why Node/Express applications are so performant?_

- Node's Asynchronous / Event-driven design enables non-blocking Input/Output.
- A typical Node server is capable of supporting tens of thousands of concurrent connections!

### _5. Is...const el = document.getElementById('my-list');a valid JavaScript statement in a Node app?_

No.  **_document.getElementById_**  is used in the HTML DOM (Document Object Model) API for manipulating HTML documents with the help of JavaScript programming language, used for Front End development. 


### _6. What is a Model?_

**Model** is the class that implements the schema and gives us javascript methods we can use to interact with MongoDb Database. It automatically makes a Collection in the DB, comprised of **Documents** that pass the **Schema**.

### _7. What is A View Engine?_

- It is responsible for converting the server-side template into HTML markup and rendering it to the browser.
- **View Engine** is the combination of HTML tags, Server Controls and a programming language and works inside the application for rendering view to the browser or to the user. 
- **View engines** allow us to render web pages using template files. These templates are filled with actual data and served to the client. 

### _8. What is A DataController?_

**DataController.js** (in our Fruit App case) is a file in **Controllers** component from MVC web development framework, in which we added a code with **actions** **(INDUCES)** and Mongoose methods to be performed on our Fruit model. 

### _9. What is A ViewController?_

**RouteController.js** (in our Fruit App case) is a file in **Controllers** component from MVC web development framework, in which we added a code that is showing the output in the browser by using **.render** and **.redirect** Express functions. 

### _10. What is A RouteController?_

**RouteController.js** (in our Fruit App case) is a file in **Controllers** component from MVC web development framework, in which we added a code with the **URL** routes and **HTTP Verbs (methods)** **(CRUD)** to be performed on our Fruit model.

Route Controller allows to create the controller classes with methods used to handle the requests.


### _11. What is Express Middleware?_

Express middleware is a set of functions that execute during the processing of HTTP requests received by an Express application. Middleware functions access the HTTP request and response objects. They either terminate the HTTP request or forward it for further processing to another middleware function.
