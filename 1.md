**####How Does The Internet Work?####**

*The user (client) sends the request to the remote server through the router (a package of code OR a device that forwards data packets?), the remote server gets the requested data from the database, 'packs' it and sends it back to the end client through the router.*

**####What do HTML, CSS, and JavaScript do?####**

_HTML, CSS, and JavaScript create a visual form of a website (app) for end user._

- HTML is used for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser, it is used to build the structure of a web page. 
- CSS is used to create a presentation/appearance of a web page (colors, layout, fonts). 
- JavaScript is used to create and control dynamic website content, anything that moves, refreshes, or changes on the screen without requiring a user to manually reload a web page.

#### __What is the difference between backend and frontend?__####

*Front-end development focuses on the visual aspects of a website â€“ the part that users see and interact with. Back-end development comprises a site's structure, system, data, and logic.*
